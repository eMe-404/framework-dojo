    <h3>container in dependency injection</h3>
    in our application context the runtime environment is called `container`, it will be instantiated during
    <span class="function" data-action="initApplication"> application start time</span>,<br>
    after application instantiated you can retrieve the active `container` detail by
    `DojoContextUtils.getDojoContainer()`<br>
    the retrieved result should not be null, and can print welcome message
    <span class="assertion" data-expect="equal"
          data-action="retrieveActiveContainer">container initialized successfully</span>
